What is a symlink (symbolic link, soft link)?
A special kind of file that serves as a pointer to another file/directory.
It stores the pathname of the target file/directory.  The OS automatically
resolves to the target file/directory when the symlink is accessed.  This 
is why if the target file is deleted or moved, the symlink becomes dangling. 
A symbolic link can also point to files/directories in another file system
on the same or remote drive.  The purpose of symbolic links is to simplify paths and allow access to files across different file systems on the same drive or remote drives.

To create a symlink, use the link command ln:
ln -s <path_to_existing_file/directory> <path_to_symlink_file>
Now, the file/directory can be accessed using the symlink just like the original

To see the symlink:
ls -l
Example output: lrwxrwxrwx 1 user group 8 Feb 20 18:00 symlink -> target
An 'l' appears at the beginning of permissions column

To remove a symlink:
rm <path_to_symlink_file>
