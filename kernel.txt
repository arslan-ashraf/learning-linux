-------------------- What are the key components of the kernel? -------------------

PROCESS MANAGEMENT - virtualizing the CPU, managing processes & threads and their
scheduling, facilitating multitasking, interprocess communication

MEMORY MANAGEMENT - virtualizing physical memory, allocating and deallocating 
memory to processes/threads

FILE SYSTEM MANAGEMENT - facilitating file I/O, organizing, storing and retrieving
data efficiently using caching, kernel memory buffers for reads & writes

NETWORKING STACK - implementing TCP/UDP and IP protocols

DEVICE DRIVERS - handling software(signals) and hardware interrupts and device I/O

SYSTEM CALL APIs - a mechanism for user programs to call the kernel
